                  I am an information technology enthusiast, especially in the field of web programming. Since high school, I have self-taught and learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some frameworks such as ReactJS, Nodejs, Expressjs... I love the creativity and flexibility in designing FE, as well as BE that works behind every website.

                <p className='text__para mt-[30px]'>
                  I participated and completed some small website-building projects during my time studying at the University. On the path of passion, I understand that each project helps me improve my skills and problem-solving ability, no matter how big or small.                
                </p>
                <p className='text__para mt-[30px]'>
                  My career goal in IT, specifically web programming, is to become a Full-Stack Developer. Not only do I want to sharpen my front-end skills but also master the back-end so I can confidently build a project from A to Z.                
                </p>
                <p className='text__para mt-[30px]'>
                  Meanwhile, I am also fond of security issues on the web, an area that I think is very important but sometimes underestimated. I hope to contribute to the IT community with products that ensure user information security.
